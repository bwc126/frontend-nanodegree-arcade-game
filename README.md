Students should use this rubric: https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud015/l-3072058665/m-3072588797

for self-checking their submission.

To Run:

-Open index.html in a modern browser capable of running HTML5's canvas element (>IE9, Chrome v4, Firefox v2, etc.).

-The scripts app.js, engine.js and the 'images' folder must be in the same parent directory as index.html to correctly load the game assets and code.

To Play:

-At the character selection screen, press numbers 1-5 to choose an avatar. Press enter to begin the game.

-Once the game has begun, use the arrow keys to change the character's position.

-Avoid the bugs.

-If an enemy gets you, your position and score will be reset.

-Collect gems to increase your score.

-Reach the water tiles to increase your score and reset the board, loading new gems and enemies. This kind of reset allows you to keep your score. This makes the game a balancing act between collecting the gems to increase your score and avoiding enemies so as to not lose it all.
